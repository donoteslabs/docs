# Forgot username/password

Don't worry if you've forgotten your username or password!
If you still have access to the e-mail you used to sign up to donotes, then you can recover your username and reset your password.

## Opening Forgot Tool

The forgot data tool can recover your account information. Simply click on **[Forgot Password](https://auth.donotes.app/forgot_password)** or navigate to:

> https://auth.donotes.app/forgot_password

## Using Forgot Tool

Enter your e-mail and click 'Send password reset link'

### Getting your username

You should shortly receive an e-mail. If you can't find it, check your **spam** or **junk** folders. When you receive your e-mail, it should look like this:

As you can see, your username is mentioned in the e-mail.

If you wish to reset your password, see below

### Resetting your password

To reset your password, copy the 6-digit code from the e-mail and paste it into the "Code" screen back at the password reset tool and click **Check Code**

# Creating an account

Create a **donotes** account

## Getting Started

Get started by **[opening donotes](https://v8.donotes.app)**.

### What you'll need

- A username
  - This needs to be unique, and not conform to our username eligibility requirements.
- An e-mail address
  - This cannot be a previously used e-mail address for a DoNotes account (this includes older donotes accounts)
- A **secure** password
  - This must be unique, and we recommend using a secure password manager to help keep your account secure

## Getting to the sign up screen

When you navigate to **[opening donotes](https://v8.donotes.app)**, you should see this:

Click the **Sign up** button and the screen will change to this:

## Signing up

Go ahead and enter your username, e-mail and password. Make sure to also check that you agree to the Terms and Conditions.

Click **Sign Up**

> :warning: If the Sign Up button is greyed out, it means you have entered an invalid username, email or password or you haven't agreed to the Terms and Conditions. Sometimes the button may be still greyed out, this is common if you have browser auto-fill. In this case simply click on the button and it should realise that you have entered your information and will become coloured again
